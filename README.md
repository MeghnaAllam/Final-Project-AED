# Covi-Track
>A safety net to follow COVID-19

## About the project: 

We urgently need a system that monitors patient records, immunization records, and health throughout a city in the era of COVID. The goal of our project is to create a network that links a hospital, immunization clinics, vaccine producers, and other associated businesses to an entire city in a controlled environment. The ecosystem may manage the records of the city's residents, its hospitals with employees and doctors, its vaccination centers, and its immunization providers. Our objective is to offer a practical method for managing the records of a city's populace.

## Problem Statement:

Since 2020, the entire world has got severely affected by the COVID-19 virus. This created a global health disaster. We suffered heavy losses in terms of lives lost, revenue, the medical ecosystem was greatly challenged during this crisis.

The purpose of our ecosystem is to establish a network of cities that connects a person to an organization and enterprise consisting of Vaccination Center, Vaccine Manufacturer, Hospital and a Testing Lab. We have designed an ecosystem where we manage the entire Vaccine Distribution, Vaccination Status for the citizens, COVID-19 testing, admit Patients for Doctor consultation and tracking their Vital Signs
We have 4 Enterprises, 9 Organizations and 10 Roles
This demonstrates the robustness of our Ecosystem. We aim to provide an easy and user friendly workflow for a safer world for fighting COVID-19. Following are the features of our application.
- Hospitals can idetify patients and their medical history
- Doctors and staff can check medical vaccination status of a patiet and schedule vaccination appointmens for them
- Ability for Vaccination Centers to provide vaccines to a person and hospital patients
- Ability for Vaccination Centers to create a vaccine demand from Vaccine Manufacturers
- Ability for Vaccine Manufacturers to create vaccines and supply them to the the centers on demand
