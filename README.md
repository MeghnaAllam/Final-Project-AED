# Covi-Track
>A safety net to follow COVID-19

## About the project: 

We urgently need a system that monitors patient records, immunization records, and health throughout a city in the era of COVID. The goal of our project is to create a network that links a hospital, immunization clinics, vaccine producers, and other associated businesses to an entire city in a controlled environment. The ecosystem may manage the records of the city's residents, its hospitals with employees and doctors, its vaccination centers, and its immunization providers. Our objective is to offer a practical method for managing the records of a city's populace.

## Problem Statement:

The COVID-19 virus has been wreaking havoc on the entire world since 2020. This resulted in a worldwide health disaster. We suffered significant losses in terms of lives lost and revenue, and the medical ecosystem was severely tested during this crisis.
As of December 2022, the number of confirmed and presumptive positive COVID-19 cases reported in the United States had reached around 49.7 million, with nearly 794 thousand deaths among these cases.


## Solution:


The goal of our ecosystem is to create a network of cities that connects a person to a Vaccination Center, a Vaccine Manufacturer, a Hospital, and a Testing Lab. We have created an ecosystem in which we manage the complete Vaccine Distribution, Citizens' Vaccination Status, COVID-19 testing, admit Patients for Doctor Consultation, and track their Vital Signs.
We have four enterprises, nine organizations, and ten roles.
This displays our Ecosystem's resilience. We hope to develop a simple and user-friendly workflow for battling COVID-19 in a safer society. Our application's features are as follows.
- Hospitals can identify patients and their medical history - Doctors and staff can check a patient's medical vaccination status and schedule vaccination appointments for them - Vaccination Centers can provide vaccines to individuals and hospital patients - Vaccination Centers can create a vaccine demand from Vaccine Manufacturers - Vaccine Manufacturers can create vaccines and supply them to the centers on demand
